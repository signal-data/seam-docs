## Prerequisites

<Warning>
**Firewall Configuration Required**

If your database is behind a firewall, you must allow connections from the following Seam IP addresses:
- 34.171.4.17
- 54.190.82.25
- 44.232.40.21
- 35.155.106.54
- 54.200.67.134
- 44.224.213.129
- 54.149.95.139
</Warning>

## Required Information

To connect your BigQuery warehouse to Seam, you'll need to provide:

1. **BigQuery Project ID** (required)
2. **Service Account JSON** (required)
3. **Dataset ID** (optional)

---

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Locate Your BigQuery Project ID

Your Project ID can be found in the BigQuery console as shown below. Copy this value to use when configuring your Seam connection.

### 2. Create a Service Account

You'll need to create a service account that Seam will use to access your BigQuery project and datasets.

**Step 1:** Create a new service account in your BigQuery project by following [Google's service account creation guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create).

<Note>
Ensure you create the service account in the same project where your dataset is located.
</Note>

**Step 2:** Assign the following roles to the service account:
- `BigQuery Job User`
- `BigQuery Data Viewer`
- `BigQuery Metadata Viewer`

**Step 3:** Generate a JSON key file for the service account by following [Google's credential creation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete). You'll upload this JSON file to Seam.

### 3. Specify a Dataset ID (Optional)

If you want to limit Seam's access to a specific dataset, provide the Dataset ID. You can find this in the BigQuery console as shown below.

<Note>
**Important:** The Dataset ID is different from your Project ID or table name.

If you don't specify a Dataset ID, Seam will connect to all datasets the service account has access to.
