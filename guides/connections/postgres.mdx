## Prerequisites
<Warning>
**Firewall Configuration Required**

If your database is behind a firewall, you must allow connections from the following Seam IP addresses:
- 34.171.4.17
- 54.190.82.25
- 44.232.40.21
- 35.155.106.54
- 54.200.67.134
- 44.224.213.129
- 54.149.95.139
</Warning>

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Create a Seam User in PostgreSQL

You'll need to create a dedicated read-only user for Seam to access your PostgreSQL database. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using a SQL client with admin credentials to run these commands.

#### SQL Commands

Replace the following placeholders in the commands below:
- `<schema>` - The name of your PostgreSQL schema
- `<table>` - The name of your PostgreSQL table (if using Option 2)
- `<password>` - A randomly generated password (save this for later)
```sql
-- Create a new user for Seam
CREATE USER seam_postgres_integration_user WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

-- Grant access to the schema (always required)
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO seam_postgres_integration_user;

-- Option 1: Grant read-access to all tables in the schema
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO seam_postgres_integration_user;

-- Option 2: Grant access to specific tables (repeat as necessary)
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE <schema>.<table> TO seam_postgres_integration_user;
```

<Note>
You can modify the `GRANT` statements to limit the scope of Seam's permissions. Choose Option 1 to grant access to all tables in a schema, or Option 2 to grant access only to specific tables.
</Note>

### 2. Gather Connection Details

You'll need the following information to complete the Seam connection:

<ParamField path="username" type="string" required>
  The username you created (e.g., `seam_postgres_integration_user`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="password" type="string" required>
  The password you set for the Seam user
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="host" type="string" required>
  Your database's host address (e.g., `123.456.789.012` or `subdomain.example.com`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="database" type="string" required>
  Database name
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="port" type="number" default="5432">
  Port (default: 5432)
</ParamField>

## Next Steps

Once you've created the Seam user and gathered your connection details, you can complete the connection setup in the Seam platform.
