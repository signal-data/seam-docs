We would suggest connecting to Outreach using an account that has admin privileges.

## ⭐️ Authenticate

1. Go to **Settings** -> **Sources** -> **Outreach**

2. Set `Env Name`. This can be something like `Prod` or `Sandbox` .&#x20;

3. Click "Sign in with Outreach" - You will be redirected to Outreach to authenticate and authorize our application.

4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for **Destinations.**
