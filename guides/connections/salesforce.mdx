## Prerequisites

We require two prerequisites to connect Salesforce to Seam

1. [Salesforce Account](https://login.salesforce.com/) with Enterprise access or API quota purchased
2. Dedicated Salesforce [user](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=adding_new_users.htm&type=5&language=en_US) (optional)

## Step 1: (Optional, Recommended) Create a read-only Salesforce user

While you can set up the Salesforce connector using any Salesforce user with read permission, we recommend creating a dedicated read-only user for Seam. This allows you to granularly control the data Seam can read.

To create a dedicated read only Salesforce user:

1. [Log into Salesforce](https://login.salesforce.com/) with an admin account.
2. On the top right of the screen, click the gear icon and then click **Setup**.
3. In the left navigation bar, under Administration, click **Users** > **Profiles**. The Profiles page is displayed. Click **New profile**.
4. For Existing Profile, select **Read only**. For Profile Name, enter **Seam Read Only User**.
5. Click **Save**. The Profiles page is displayed. Click **Edit**.
6. Scroll down to the **Standard Object Permissions** and **Custom Object Permissions** and enable the **Read** checkbox for objects that you want to replicate via Seam.
7. Scroll to the top and click **Save**.
8. On the left side, under Administration, click **Users** > **Users**. The All Users page is displayed. Click **New User**.
9. Fill out the required fields:
   1. For License, select **Salesforce**.
   2. For Profile, select **Seam Read Only User**.
   3. For Email, make sure to use an email address that you can access.
10. Click **Save**.
11. Copy the Username and keep it accessible.
12. Log into the email you used above and verify your new Salesforce account user. You'll need to set a password as part of this process. Keep this password accessible.

## Step 2: Set up the Salesforce source in Seam

1. [Log in to your Seam](https://app.getseam.ai/) account.
2. In the left navigation bar, click **Settings**. Navigate to the **Sources** tab, under the connections section. In the top-right corner, click **+ Add source**.
3. Find and select **Salesforce** from the list of available sources.
4. To authenticate: Click **Login with Salesforce** to authorize your Salesforce account. Seam will authenticate the Salesforce account you are already logged in to. Please make sure you are logged into the right account.
5. Toggle whether your Salesforce account is a [Sandbox account](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.deploy_sandboxes_parent.htm&type=5) or a production account.
6. Select the Objects you want Seam to have access to.
7. Enter a **Source name** of your choosing to help you identify this source.
8. Click Finish to finalize and Seam will start to connect to your data.
