description: "Automatically assign contacts to the right sales reps based on territory, ownership, or custom rules"

Routing ensures that every contact Seam prospects is automatically assigned to the right sales representative. Instead of manually distributing leads, routing rules handle assignment automatically as part of your plays.

## Why Routing Matters

Without routing, automated prospecting creates problems:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Orphan Contacts" icon="user-slash">
    Contacts created in CRM with no owner, falling through the cracks
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Wrong Rep Assignment" icon="user-xmark">
    Leads sent to the wrong territory or inbox, causing confusion
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Manual Distribution" icon="hand-pointer">
    Someone has to manually assign leads after prospecting
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Slow Follow-Up" icon="clock">
    Delays while waiting for manual assignment before outreach
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Routing solves this by automatically assigning contacts the moment they're prospected, ensuring immediate follow-up from the right person.

## How Routing Works

Routing is configured as part of plays and executes during the workflow:
```
Trigger fires (intent signal, website visit, etc.)
  ↓
Audience filter determines qualifying accounts
  ↓
Prospecting finds personas within accounts
  ↓
Routing assigns contacts to appropriate rep ← You are here
  ↓
Deployment pushes to CRM and sales sequences
```

The routing decision happens before deployment, ensuring contacts arrive in systems with proper ownership already set.

## Routing Methods

Seam supports multiple routing methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Account Owner">
    **Routes to whoever owns the account in your CRM**
    
    - Most common method for existing accounts
    - Maintains consistent ownership
    - Works for multi-threading plays
    
    **Example:** All contacts at Acme Corp route to the SDR who owns the Acme account
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Round Robin">
    **Distributes leads evenly across team members in a queue**
    
    - Fair distribution for new inbound leads
    - Balances workload across team
    - Can be regional or team-specific
    
    **Example:** Website visitors rotate through 5 SDRs in order
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Contact Owner">
    **Routes based on existing contact ownership**
    
    - Useful when contacts already exist
    - Maintains relationship continuity
    - Falls back to account owner if no contact owner
    
    **Example:** Re-engagement campaigns route to original contact owner
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Custom CRM Field">
    **Uses specific fields in your CRM for routing logic**
    
    - Flexible for complex territory rules
    - Leverages existing CRM assignments
    - Can reference any account or contact field
    
    **Example:** Route based on "SDR Owner" or "Territory" field
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Geographic/Regional">
    **Routes based on company location or territory**
    
    - Ensures regional expertise
    - Handles international coverage
    - Can combine with other methods
    
    **Example:** EMEA accounts to EMEA team, US West to West Coast reps
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Majority Rule">
    **Routes to whoever owns the majority of contacts at an account**
    
    - Useful for expanding coverage
    - Maintains consistency when adding contacts
    - Falls back if no majority exists
    
    **Example:** Adding 3 new contacts to account where Sarah owns 4 existing contacts → routes to Sarah
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Options

### Within Play Setup

Routing is configured when building a play:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Trigger and Audience">
    Set conditions for when the play runs and which accounts qualify
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Prospecting">
    Define which personas to find at qualifying accounts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Routing Rules">
    Choose routing method (account owner, round robin, custom field, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Deployment">
    Specify where routed contacts should be sent (CRM, sequences, ads)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Routing Priority

You can set fallback routing:

1. **Primary:** Try account owner first
2. **Fallback:** If no account owner, use round robin queue
3. **Default:** If no queue assignment, route to manager

This ensures every contact gets assigned even if primary routing fails.

## Integration with Systems

Routing works across your connected tools:

### CRM Systems

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Salesforce">
    - Routes to account owner field
    - Creates contacts with proper owner assignment
    - Uses custom fields for routing logic
    - Respects existing ownership rules
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="HubSpot">
    - Bi-directional sync of ownership
    - Routes based on HubSpot properties
    - Updates owner fields automatically
    - Works with HubSpot workflows
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Sales Engagement Platforms

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SalesLoft">
    - Routes to correct rep's SalesLoft inbox
    - Adds to sequences from proper sender
    - Maintains rep-specific cadences
    - Ensures correct email sender
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Outreach">
    - Deploys to individual rep's Outreach account
    - Routes to appropriate sequences
    - Sets proper ownership before sending
    - Tracks activity back to correct rep
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
**Critical:** Routing must happen before deployment to sales engagement tools. If you deploy first and route later, emails will send from the wrong inbox.
</Warning>

## Routing vs. Existing Systems

You have two options for how routing works:

### Option 1: Seam Creates, CRM Routes

Seam creates contacts in your CRM, then existing CRM routing rules handle assignment.

**When to use:**
- You have complex routing logic already built in Salesforce
- Your CRM routing includes territory management and role hierarchies
- You want CRM to remain single source of truth for assignments

### Option 2: Seam Routes, Then Deploys

Seam applies routing rules, then creates contacts with ownership already set.

**When to use:**
- You want to centralize routing logic in Seam
- CRM routing is limited or difficult to maintain
- You need routing to work consistently across multiple systems

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Use Seam routing for some plays, CRM routing for others.

**When to use:**
- Different teams have different preferences
- Some use cases need custom logic, others work with CRM defaults
- You're transitioning from CRM routing to Seam routing gradually

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Match routing to ownership model" icon="sitemap">
    If your team uses account-based ownership, route by account owner. If you use round robin for inbound, route that way. Mirror your existing model.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set fallback rules" icon="shield">
    Always define what happens if primary routing fails. Don't create orphan contacts—route to a manager or default queue instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test before scaling" icon="flask">
    Run plays on small audience first to verify routing works correctly. Check that contacts appear with right owners in right systems.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Align routing with sequences" icon="link">
    If SDRs have personalized sequences, route to the rep whose sequence they should enter. Don't separate routing from sequence assignment.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor distribution metrics" icon="chart-line">
    For round robin, check that distribution stays balanced. Some reps might be out of office or at capacity—adjust queues accordingly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document routing logic" icon="file-lines">
    As routing gets complex, document rules so team members understand why leads route where they do. This helps with troubleshooting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review quarterly" icon="calendar">
    Territory changes, team changes, and ownership models evolve. Review routing rules quarterly to ensure they still match your structure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Preventing Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Orphan Contacts">
    **Problem:** Contacts created with no owner
    
    **Solution:** Always set fallback routing. If primary method fails, route to default queue or manager
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong Inbox Sender">
    **Problem:** Emails send from wrong rep's email address
    
    **Solution:** Route BEFORE deploying to sales engagement tools, not after
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplicate Ownership">
    **Problem:** Multiple reps claim same account
    
    **Solution:** Use CRM account owner as source of truth, not contact-level routing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Uneven Distribution">
    **Problem:** Some reps get far more leads than others
    
    **Solution:** Use round robin instead of custom logic if fairness matters more than specialization
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lost Context">
    **Problem:** Rep doesn't know why they got the lead
    
    **Solution:** Include routing reason in CRM fields or task description ("Routed: Website Visitor - Pricing Page")
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I route to multiple people?">
    Not directly. Routing assigns one owner per contact. However, you can create tasks or notifications for additional team members while primary ownership goes to one person.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if the assigned rep leaves the company?">
    Routing uses current CRM data. If the account owner field updates to a new rep, future plays will route to the new owner. Existing contacts remain with original owner unless manually reassigned.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can routing trigger other automations?">
    Yes. Many CRMs have workflows that trigger on contact creation or owner change. Seam routing can kick off these downstream automations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does routing work for existing contacts?">
    Yes. You can route based on existing contact owner (maintains continuity) or override and route based on account owner or other rules.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I exclude certain reps from round robin?">
    Yes. Configure your round robin queue to include only active reps. Remove people who are out of office, at capacity, or shouldn't receive certain lead types.
  </Accordion>
