description: "Automated workflows that prospect, enrich, and deploy contacts based on fit, intent, and signals"
---

Plays are automated workflows that turn account intelligence into action. When accounts meet specific criteria—like visiting your website, showing intent, or hiring a key role—Plays automatically prospect contacts, enrich their data, and deploy them into your sales and marketing systems.

## What Are Plays?

Plays are the orchestration engine of Seam AI. While Fit, Intent, Signals, and Audiences tell you **who** to target and **when**, Plays handle the **how**—automating the entire process from signal detection to contact deployment.

<Info>
**Think of Plays as "If This, Then That" for B2B sales:** If an account meets your criteria, then automatically find the right people, get their contact info, and add them to sequences.
</Info>

## The Plays Workflow

Every play follows a four-step workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger & Audience">
    **Define when the play runs and which accounts qualify**
    
    - Set trigger conditions (intent spike, website visit, new hire)
    - Define audience criteria using Fit, Intent, Signals, Reach
    - Choose always-on (continuous) or one-off (single run)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Auto-Prospect">
    **Automatically find the right contacts within accounts**
    
    - Use predefined personas to identify buying committee
    - Specify how many contacts per account (e.g., 3-5 people)
    - AI searches for people matching persona criteria
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enrichment">
    **Get verified contact information**
    
    - Email addresses with triple verification
    - Mobile phone numbers with validation
    - Multi-provider waterfall for best data quality
    - Duplicate checking against existing CRM records
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deployment & Routing">
    **Push contacts into your systems with proper assignment**
    
    - Route to appropriate sales rep (territory, account owner, round robin)
    - Deploy to CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot)
    - Add to sales sequences (Outreach, SalesLoft)
    - Push to ad platforms (LinkedIn, Google Ads)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Types of Plays

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Always-On Plays">
    **Continuous automation that runs whenever criteria are met**
    
    **When to use:**
    - High-intent website visitor engagement
    - New hire tracking and outreach
    - Competitor mention monitoring
    - Mid-tier account air cover
    
    **How it works:**
    - Play monitors audience continuously
    - When account enters audience, actions trigger
    - Runs indefinitely until you pause it
    
    **Example:** "Whenever an A/B fit account visits pricing page 3+ times, find 3 contacts and add to sequence"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="One-Off Plays">
    **Single-run campaigns for specific initiatives**
    
    **When to use:**
    - Event follow-up campaigns
    - Product launch targeting
    - Named account list expansion
    - Quarterly ABM campaigns
    
    **How it works:**
    - Play runs once on current audience members
    - Completes after processing all accounts
    - Can be re-run manually if needed
    
    **Example:** "Process list of 500 conference attendees, enrich data, and route to sales"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Strategic ABM Plays">
    **Highly targeted campaigns for top-tier accounts**
    
    **When to use:**
    - Named account lists (top 50-100 accounts)
    - Enterprise deal acceleration
    - Multi-threaded account expansion
    - Executive engagement programs
    
    **How it works:**
    - Manually defined account list
    - Deep prospecting (5-7 contacts per account)
    - Multi-channel coordination (ads + email + SDR)
    - Often combined with personalized content
    
    **Example:** "Find entire buying committee at 25 target Fortune 500 accounts and coordinate multi-channel outreach"
  </Tab>

## Building a Play

### Step-by-Step Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Play Type">
    Decide if this is always-on or one-off based on your use case
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Your Audience">
    Use the Audience Builder to set criteria:
    
    - **Fit Score:** A or B (only target good-fit accounts)
    - **Intent:** Visited website 3+ times in past 7 days
    - **Signals:** Not in open opportunity
    - **Exclusions:** Not competitors, not existing customers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Prospecting">
    Set up contact sourcing:
    
    - Select personas to target (e.g., VP Marketing, Director Demand Gen)
    - Set contacts per account (3-5 for most plays)
    - Enable/disable prospecting if contacts already exist
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Enrichment Options">
    Configure data quality:
    
    - Email verification level (standard or triple-verified)
    - Mobile number enrichment (optional, costs more credits)
    - Duplicate checking (recommended to avoid over-contacting)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Routing">
    Assign contacts to the right reps:
    
    - Account owner (most common)
    - Round robin (for fair distribution)
    - Custom field (for complex territory logic)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Deployment">
    Choose where contacts should go:
    
    - **CRM:** Create/update records in Salesforce or HubSpot
    - **Sales Sequences:** Add to Outreach, SalesLoft, or Apollo
    - **Ad Platforms:** Push to LinkedIn or Google matched audiences
    - **Marketing Automation:** Trigger Marketo campaigns
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and Launch">
    - Preview the audience size
    - Test with a small subset first (10-20 accounts)
    - Monitor results for 1-2 weeks
    - Scale up once validated
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multi-Channel Deployment

Plays can deploy contacts to multiple systems simultaneously:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CRM Systems">
    **Salesforce & HubSpot**
    
    - Create contact and account records
    - Update existing records with new data
    - Set custom fields (fit score, intent signals, play name)
    - Create tasks for assigned reps
    - Trigger CRM workflows
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sales Engagement">
    **Outreach, SalesLoft, Apollo**
    
    - Add to specific sequences/cadences
    - Route to correct rep's inbox
    - Set priority or tag for context
    - Schedule first touch timing
    - Track engagement back to play
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Ad Platforms">
    **LinkedIn Ads & Google Ads**
    
    - Build matched audiences automatically
    - Update audiences in real-time as accounts qualify
    - Remove accounts when they exit criteria
    - Coordinate timing with sales outreach
    - Measure ad engagement as intent signal
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Marketing Automation">
    **Marketo & Other MAPs**
    
    - Add to nurture campaigns
    - Trigger email sends
    - Update lead scoring
    - Segment for targeted content
    - Sync status back to Seam
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Coordination Example:**

When an account enters a play, Seam can simultaneously:
1. Create contacts in Salesforce with fit/intent scores
2. Add contacts to SalesLoft sequence from assigned rep
3. Push account to LinkedIn matched audience for retargeting
4. Send Slack notification to account owner
5. Create high-priority task in CRM

All of this happens automatically within minutes of the trigger firing.

## Integration with Intelligence Layer

Plays are powered by all the intelligence features you've configured:
```
Fit Score ─────┐
               ├──► Audience ──► Play Trigger ──► Actions
Intent Score ──┤
               │
Signals ───────┤
               │
Reach Score ───┘

Personas ──────────────► Auto-Prospect Step

Routing ───────────────► Deployment Step
```

**Example:** A play that combines everything:
- **Fit:** Only A/B accounts
- **Intent:** Website visit + Bombora surge
- **Signals:** New hire in past 30 days
- **Reach:** Low (not currently engaged)
- **Personas:** Find CMO + VP Demand Gen + Director MarOps
- **Routing:** Assign to territory owner
- **Deploy:** SalesLoft sequence + LinkedIn ads + Salesforce task

This level of sophistication would require significant manual work without Plays.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple, then layer complexity" icon="layer-group">
    Your first play should be straightforward: "High-fit accounts that visited website → find 3 contacts → add to sequence." Once that works, add more conditions and channels.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Always include Fit as a filter" icon="filter">
    Never run plays without filtering by Fit Score. Automating outreach to poor-fit accounts wastes credits and damages brand. Always start with A/B fit minimum.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set appropriate contact limits" icon="users">
    - **A-tier accounts:** 5-7 contacts (full buying committee)
    - **B-tier accounts:** 3-4 contacts (key decision-makers)
    - **C-tier accounts:** 1-2 contacts (primary only)
    
    More contacts = better coverage but higher costs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test with small audiences first" icon="flask">
    Run plays on 20-50 accounts before scaling to thousands. Verify routing works, sequences load correctly, and messaging resonates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Name plays descriptively" icon="tag">
    "HighIntent_PricingPage_ABFit_3Contacts" is better than "Website Play 1". You'll have dozens of plays eventually—clear names help you manage them.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor credit consumption" icon="coins">
    Plays consume credits based on prospecting and enrichment volume. Track credit burn rate and adjust contact limits or audience size if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Coordinate timing across channels" icon="clock">
    If deploying to both ads and sales sequences, consider timing. You might want ads to run for 2 weeks before sales outreach, warming up accounts first.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use exclusion criteria liberally" icon="ban">
    Always exclude:
    - Competitors
    - Existing customers (unless expansion play)
    - Accounts in late-stage opportunities
    - Recently closed-lost accounts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review performance monthly" icon="chart-line">
    Track which plays generate pipeline. Double down on high-performing plays, pause or refine underperformers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Align plays with sales process" icon="handshake">
    Work with sales team to ensure plays support their workflow. If SDRs prefer warm intros, don't auto-add to cold sequences. Match automation to human process.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Credits & Pricing

Plays operate on a credit-based model:

| Action | Credit Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| **Account Research** | 1 credit per account |
| **Contact Prospecting** | 1 credit per contact found |
| **Email Enrichment** | Included in prospecting |
| **Mobile Enrichment** | Additional 0.5 credits per contact |
| **Triple Verification** | Additional 0.25 credits per contact |
| **Deployment** | No credits (pushing to systems is free) |

**Example Play Cost:**
- Audience: 100 accounts enter play
- Prospecting: 3 contacts per account = 300 contacts
- Email enrichment: Included
- Mobile enrichment: Optional (150 additional credits)
- **Total:** 400 credits (or 550 with mobile)

## Monitoring Play Performance

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Accounts processed:** How many accounts entered the play
- **Contacts found:** Prospecting success rate
- **Contact quality:** Email deliverability and mobile accuracy
- **Response rates:** Engagement with deployed sequences
- **Pipeline generated:** Opportunities attributed to the play
- **Cost per opportunity:** Credits spent divided by opps created

### Play Analytics Dashboard

Seam tracks performance for each play:
- Trigger frequency (how often play fires)
- Prospecting success rate (contacts found per account)
- Enrichment quality (email/mobile validation rates)
- Deployment success (contacts successfully added to systems)
- Downstream engagement (opens, clicks, responses)
- Pipeline attribution (opportunities and revenue)

Use these metrics to optimize plays over time.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many plays should I have?">
    Most customers run 5-15 active plays. Start with 2-3 core plays (high-intent, new hire, mid-tier air cover), then expand based on results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can one account be in multiple plays?">
    Yes. An account could trigger a website visitor play AND a new hire play. Seam handles deduplication to avoid over-contacting the same people.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if a play fails?">
    Seam monitors play execution and alerts you if actions fail (e.g., CRM API error, routing failure). Failed actions can be retried manually.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I pause plays?">
    Yes. You can pause, edit, or archive plays anytime. Paused plays stop processing new accounts but don't affect contacts already deployed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How quickly do plays execute?">
    Most plays complete within 5-15 minutes from trigger to deployment. Prospecting and enrichment take 30-60 seconds per account, plus deployment time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I customize pre-built plays?">
    Absolutely. Pre-built plays are templates. Clone them and modify audience criteria, personas, routing, or deployment channels to fit your needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do plays respect do-not-contact lists?">
    Yes. Seam checks against CRM do-not-contact fields and unsubscribe lists before deployment. You can also add custom suppression rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
