title: "Intent"
description: "Identify accounts actively engaging with your brand and researching your space"
---

Intent tracks whether companies are showing interest in your business by monitoring engagement signals across multiple channels. This helps you identify buyers earlier in the process and engage before competitors.

## What is Intent?

Intent is one of four scoring dimensions Seam uses to evaluate accounts:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Fit** | Does the company match your ICP? |
| **Intent** | Are they interacting with your brand? |
| **Signals** | External buying signals (hiring, funding) |
| **Reach** | Can you engage with them? |

Intent specifically tracks engagement across your digital properties and third-party channels to identify accounts actively researching or evaluating solutions in your space.

## Data Sources

Seam aggregates intent signals from first-party and third-party sources:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="First-Party Intent">
    **Onsite engagement you control:**
    
    - Website visits (de-anonymized via web pixel)
    - Email opens, clicks, and responses
    - Ad interactions (LinkedIn, Google)
    - Sales activity (meetings, emails)
    - Event attendance and engagement
    - Content downloads and form fills
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Third-Party Intent">
    **Offsite signals from external sources:**
    
    - **Bombora** - Topic research across B2B web
    - **Social listening** - LinkedIn and Twitter mentions
    - **IP-to-company** - Multiple providers in waterfall
    - **Data providers** - ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lucia, 20+ others
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Intent Scoring

Seam aggregates all engagement signals into a unified intent score for each account.

### How Scoring Works

1. **Data Collection** - Web pixel and integrations capture engagement
2. **Signal Aggregation** - All touchpoints combined per account
3. **AI Evaluation** - Patterns analyzed to determine intent level
4. **Score Assignment** - Account receives intent score (Low/Medium/High)

### Transparent Scoring

Unlike black-box solutions, Seam shows exactly which activities contributed to an account's intent score:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/intent-score-breakdown.png" alt="Intent score breakdown showing all signals" />
</Frame>

You can see:
- Which pages were visited
- How many times and when
- Email engagement patterns
- Ad interactions
- Social media activity

This transparency helps sales teams trust and act on the data.

## Website Visitor Tracking

### How It Works

Install Seam's web pixel on your site to capture anonymous visitors:
```html
<script>
  (function() {
    // Seam tracking snippet
  })();
</script>
```

Seam uses a waterfall approach with multiple IP-to-company providers to identify which companies are visiting, even if individuals don't fill out forms.

</Card>

### What Gets Tracked

- Company identified from IP address
- Pages visited and time on site
- High-intent pages (pricing, product, demo)
- Visit frequency and recency
- Visitor journey and navigation patterns

<Warning>
Website tracking identifies companies, not individuals. Use this for account-level intent, not person-level tracking.
</Warning>

## Intent in ABM Workflows

### Account Prioritization

Intent helps you focus on accounts actively showing interest:

**High Intent + High Fit = Top Priority**

Use intent scores to:
- ✅ Identify which A/B fit accounts are heating up
- ✅ Surface engaged accounts not being actively worked
- ✅ Alert reps when dormant accounts re-engage
- ✅ Allocate marketing budget to in-market accounts

### Tiered Account Strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="A/B Tier Accounts">
    **Strategic ABM**
    
    - Manually worked by sales reps
    - Intent alerts trigger personalized outreach
    - Multi-threaded engagement with buying committee
    - High-touch, customized campaigns
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Mid-Tier Accounts">
    **Automated Air Cover**
    
    - Automated plays triggered by intent
    - Scaled engagement across hundreds of accounts
    - Generic but relevant messaging
    - Ensure no high-intent account gets ignored
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Low-Tier Accounts">
    **Nurture Programs**
    
    - Drip campaigns and content marketing
    - Monitor for intent spikes
    - Promote when intent increases
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Buying Committee Targeting

When an account shows intent, Seam helps you engage the full buying committee:

1. **Detect Intent** - Company visits pricing page 5 times
2. **Research Committee** - AI finds 3-5 relevant personas
3. **Enrich Contacts** - Get accurate emails and phone numbers
4. **Multi-Thread** - Engage multiple stakeholders simultaneously
5. **Route Properly** - Assign to correct rep based on territory

## Building Intent-Based Audiences

Create dynamic audiences that update automatically as accounts show intent:

**Example Audiences:**
- "High-intent accounts not currently engaged"
- "A/B fit accounts visiting pricing page"
- "Accounts researching competitors on Bombora"
- "Event attendees showing post-event engagement"
- "Dormant accounts re-engaging"

These audiences can trigger plays, sync to ad platforms, or route to sales teams.

</Card>

## Integration with Plays

Intent signals trigger automated plays that prospect and engage accounts:

**Example Play: High-Intent Outreach**
```
Trigger: Account visits pricing page 3+ times in 7 days
  ↓
Filter: Fit Score = A or B
  ↓
Actions:
  1. Research buying committee (find 3-5 contacts)
  2. Enrich contact data (emails, phones, LinkedIn)
  3. Add to targeted email sequence
  4. Push to LinkedIn matched audience
  5. Notify assigned SDR with context
```

## Multi-Provider Approach

Seam uses a waterfall enrichment strategy with 20+ data providers to ensure the best data quality:

1. **Primary Provider** - Try highest-accuracy source first
2. **Secondary Providers** - Fall back if primary fails
3. **Tertiary Providers** - Continue until data found
4. **Best Result** - Return highest-confidence match

This ensures comprehensive coverage across:
- Geographic regions (US, EMEA, APAC, LatAm)
- Company sizes (SMB to Enterprise)
- Industry verticals
- Public vs. private companies

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Combine with Fit Score" icon="layer-group">
    Intent is most powerful when filtered by Fit. Don't chase every website visitor—focus on high-intent accounts that match your ICP.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set appropriate thresholds" icon="sliders">
    Adjust intent thresholds based on your sales cycle. Enterprise deals may require lower thresholds (earlier engagement), while SMB might need higher thresholds (closer to purchase).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Track high-intent pages" icon="star">
    Not all pages indicate equal intent. Pricing, product comparison, and demo pages signal stronger intent than blog posts or careers pages.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor recency and frequency" icon="clock">
    An account visiting once 6 months ago is different from 5 visits this week. Weight recent, repeated engagement higher.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use multi-channel signals" icon="chart-network">
    The strongest intent comes from multiple channels. Website visits + email engagement + social activity = very high intent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Act quickly on spikes" icon="bolt">
    Intent is perishable. When an account shows sudden increased activity, engage within 24-48 hours before momentum fades.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is intent different from signals?">
    **Intent** = Engagement with your brand (website visits, email opens, ad clicks)
    
    **Signals** = External events at the company (new hires, funding, job postings)
    
    Both are valuable, but intent shows direct interest while signals indicate timing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I track individual people or just companies?">
    Seam tracks companies visiting your website. Once a company is identified, you can then prospect and track individuals within that account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How accurate is IP-to-company identification?">
    Accuracy varies by provider and company size. Enterprise companies with dedicated IP ranges have 90%+ accuracy. Smaller companies may be harder to identify. Seam's multi-provider waterfall maximizes accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does intent replace lead forms?">
    No. Intent identifies anonymous research activity. Forms still capture specific individuals expressing interest. Use both together for comprehensive coverage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often does intent data update?">
    First-party intent (website, email) updates in real-time. Third-party intent (Bombora) updates weekly. Intent scores recalculate continuously.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I export intent data?">
    Yes. Intent data syncs to your CRM and data warehouse. You can also export via Seam's UI or API.
  </Accordion>
