description: "Create dynamic segments of accounts and contacts based on fit, intent, signals, and engagement"
---

Audiences are dynamic groups of companies and individuals that update automatically based on criteria you define. Think of them as smart account and contact reports that span across all your connected systems—not just your CRM.

## The Problem Audiences Solve

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fragmented Data" icon="database">
    Customer data scattered across 20+ tools. Audiences consolidate into one unified view.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Pre-Form Engagement" icon="eye">
    Most buyers decide before filling out forms. Audiences identify in-market accounts early.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Inefficient Targeting" icon="bullseye">
    Wasted effort on wrong prospects. Audiences enable precise targeting by fit and intent.

## How Audiences Work

### Building an Audience

Create segments by filtering across multiple dimensions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fit & Scoring">
    - Fit Score (A, B, C, D)
    - Intent Score (Low, Medium, High)
    - Signal Score (New hires, funding, etc.)
    - Reach Score (Coverage level)
    - Buying stage (Awareness, Consideration, Purchase)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Engagement">
    - Website visits (pages, frequency, recency)
    - Email engagement (opens, clicks, responses)
    - Ad interactions (impressions, clicks)
    - Meeting attendance
    - Content downloads
    - Event participation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Account Attributes">
    - Industry and vertical
    - Company size (employees, revenue)
    - Geographic location
    - Technologies used
    - Funding stage
    - Growth indicators
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CRM Data">
    - Opportunity stage
    - Account owner
    - Account status (customer, prospect, partner)
    - Open opportunities
    - Last activity date
    - Lead source
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Signals">
    - New hires (specific roles)
    - Job openings
    - Funding rounds
    - Promotions
    - Champion job changes
    - Social media mentions
    - Competitor mentions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Cross-System Filtering

Unlike traditional tools, Audiences filter across all connected systems simultaneously:

**Example:**
> "Companies in Salesforce that engaged with LinkedIn ads AND visited pricing page AND have A/B fit AND are not in an open opportunity AND are not competitors"

This type of complex, cross-system filtering would require custom reporting or data engineering in other platforms.

## Dynamic Updates

Audiences are not static lists—they update automatically as accounts meet or leave your criteria:

- **Account enters audience** → Triggers associated plays
- **Account exits audience** → Stops automation, moves to new audience
- **Real-time updates** → Reflects changes across all systems

<Info>
Audiences are "living" segments that continuously update based on account behavior and attributes, ensuring your targeting stays current.

## Integration with Plays

Audiences power automated plays by serving as triggers and filters:

**Example Workflow:**
```
Audience: "High-Intent Accounts Not Being Worked"
  ↓
Enters Play: "Auto-Prospecting & Deployment"
  ↓
Actions:
  1. Research buying committee (find 3-5 personas)
  2. Enrich contact data from 20+ providers
  3. Add to sales sequences (SalesLoft/Outreach)
  4. Push to LinkedIn matched audience
  5. Create tasks in Salesforce for assigned rep
  6. Send Slack notification to account owner
```

### Always-On vs. One-Off Plays

- **Always-On Plays:** Continuously monitor audience, trigger actions as accounts enter
- **One-Off Plays:** Run once on current audience members (e.g., event follow-up)

## Tiered Account Strategies

Use audiences to implement tiered ABM strategies:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tier 1: Strategic ABM">
    **Audience Criteria:**
    - Fit Score: A
    - Revenue potential: High
    - Strategic importance: Named accounts
    
    **Engagement:**
    - Direct sales ownership
    - Personalized campaigns
    - Multi-threaded outreach
    - Custom content and events
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Tier 2: Scaled ABM">
    **Audience Criteria:**
    - Fit Score: A or B
    - Revenue potential: Medium
    - Intent Score: Medium or High
    
    **Engagement:**
    - Sales-assisted with marketing automation
    - Targeted campaigns by segment
    - Automated multi-touch sequences
    - Industry-specific content
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Tier 3: Programmatic ABM">
    **Audience Criteria:**
    - Fit Score: B or C
    - Revenue potential: Lower
    - Volume: Hundreds to thousands
    
    **Engagement:**
    - Fully automated campaigns
    - Generic but relevant messaging
    - Nurture until intent increases
    - Automated lead scoring
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Different tiers receive different levels of human touch and personalization based on their potential value.

## Multi-Channel Deployment

Push audiences to your execution systems:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    Salesforce, HubSpot - Create records, update fields, assign owners
  </Card>

    SalesLoft, Outreach - Add to sequences, create tasks
  </Card>

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Marketing Automation" icon="paper-plane">

## ABM Capabilities

Audiences enable comprehensive account-based marketing:

### Account Prioritization

Score and rank accounts based on multiple dimensions, giving sales clear target lists.

### Buying Committee Identification

Define target personas (VP Marketing, Director of Ops), automatically prospect for these roles within target accounts.

### Multi-Threaded Outreach

Engage multiple contacts within an account simultaneously with coordinated messaging.

### Account Lifecycle Management

Deploy different plays based on account stage (awareness → consideration → decision).

### Integrated Campaign Orchestration

Coordinate ads, email, and sales outreach for target accounts across all channels.

<Info>
Seam competes with legacy ABM platforms like 6sense and Demandbase, but offers faster setup, easier orchestration, and unified data without complex configurations.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with clear use cases" icon="lightbulb">
    Don't try to build every possible audience at once. Start with 3-5 high-value use cases and prove ROI before expanding.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Layer filters strategically" icon="layer-group">
    Always include Fit Score as a base filter. Only engage accounts that match your ICP, regardless of intent or signals.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use exclusions" icon="ban">
    Exclude competitors, existing customers (unless targeting expansion), and accounts in late-stage opportunities to avoid noise.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test before scaling" icon="flask">
    Start with smaller audiences (50-100 accounts) to validate messaging and conversion before scaling to thousands.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor audience size" icon="chart-line">
    Audiences that are too small (under 20 accounts) may not justify automation. Too large (over 10,000) may lack specificity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review and refine monthly" icon="calendar">
    Check which audiences generate the most pipeline. Refine criteria based on conversion data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Name audiences clearly" icon="tag">
    Use descriptive names: "High-Intent_A-Fit_WebVisitors_30d" is better than "Website Audience 1"
  </Accordion>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is this different from a Salesforce report?">
    Audiences pull data from all connected systems (20+ tools), not just CRM. They also automatically prospect contacts and trigger actions, which reports cannot do.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I export audiences?">
    Yes. Export to CSV or sync to your CRM, data warehouse, or other systems via native integrations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often do audiences update?">
    Real-time for most data sources. Website visits, email engagement, and CRM changes update immediately. Some third-party data (like Bombora) updates weekly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I create audiences of people, not just companies?">
    Yes. You can filter by person-level attributes (title, seniority, engagement) to create contact-level audiences.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when an account leaves an audience?">
    Depends on your play configuration. You can stop automation, move them to a different play, or take no action. It's customizable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How many audiences can I create?">
    No hard limit. Most customers maintain 10-30 active audiences covering different segments and use cases.
