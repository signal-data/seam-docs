title: "Signals"
description: "Track external events and triggers that indicate the right time to engage accounts"
---

Signals are indicators of account activity or change that suggest a company may be receptive to outreach. They represent external triggers—like new hires, funding rounds, or job postings—that create engagement opportunities, even if the account hasn't interacted with your brand yet.

## What Are Signals?

Signals are one of four scoring dimensions Seam uses to prioritize accounts:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Fit** | Does the account match your ICP? |
| **Intent** | Are they interacting with your brand? |
| **Signals** | Are there external opportunities happening? |
| **Reach** | Can you engage with them? |

While intent shows *what* accounts are doing with your brand, signals show *when* to engage based on external events and changes at the company.

<Info>
**Key Distinction:** Intent = engagement with your content. Signals = external events creating opportunities.
</Info>

## Types of Signals

    **Organizational changes that create opportunities:**
    
    - **New Hires** - Hiring in specific roles relevant to your solution
    - **Job Openings** - Open positions indicating investment in certain areas

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Social Signals">
    **Social media activity indicating interest:**

    - Twitter/X posts about industry topics
    - Mentions of competitors (e.g., "6sense", "Demandbase")
    - Conference attendance announcements
    - Engagement with relevant content (likes, comments)

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Engagement Signals">
    **Interaction patterns across channels:**

## How Signals Trigger Automation

Signals power Seam's automated plays by triggering actions when specific events occur:

**Example Play: New VP of Sales Outreach**
```
Signal Detected: Company hires VP of Sales
  ↓
Filter: Fit Score = A or B
  ↓
Actions:
  1. Research new VP's background (previous companies, challenges)
  2. Find 2-3 additional buying committee members
  3. Enrich all contact data (emails, phones, LinkedIn)
  4. Add VP to "new executive" personalized sequence
  5. Route to appropriate account executive
  6. Notify SDR with talking points about tech stack evaluation
```

## Automated Air Cover

Signals enable "air cover" for mid-tier accounts that don't justify manual SDR time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Signal Fires">
    B-fit account posts job opening for "Data Engineer"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Prospecting">
    Seam finds 3 relevant contacts (Engineering Lead, VP Engineering, CTO)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enrichment">
    Validates emails and phone numbers from 20+ data providers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deployment">
    Adds contacts to automated nurture sequence without SDR involvement
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Escalation">
    If contacts engage, escalate to human rep for personalized follow-up
  </Step>
</Steps>

This ensures no opportunities slip through while reps focus on A-tier accounts.

## Signal-Based Segmentation

Different signals matter for different account segments:

| Account Segment | Primary Signals | Why |
|-----------------|----------------|-----|
| **Enterprise (1000+ employees)** | New hires, promotions | Leadership changes drive evaluation cycles |
| **Mid-Market (100-1000)** | Funding, rapid hiring | Growth and budget availability |
| **SMB (under 100)** | Founding team changes | New decision-makers with different preferences |
| **High-Growth** | Series B+ funding, 50+ job openings | Scaling pain points emerge |
| **International** | New market expansion posts | Entering regions you serve |

Configure plays with segment-specific signal triggers for maximum relevance.

## Social Listening

Seam monitors LinkedIn and Twitter/X for relevant signals:

### Keywords to Track

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Buying Intent Keywords">
    - "Looking for recommendations for [your category]"
    - "Evaluating [solution type]"
    - "Need help with [pain point you solve]"
    - "Anyone use [your product] or [competitor]?"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Competitor Mentions">
    - Competitor product names
    - "Frustrated with [competitor]"
    - "Switching from [competitor]"
    - "Alternative to [competitor]"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Pain Point Indicators">
    - Industry-specific challenges
    - Complaints about current tools
    - Questions about best practices
    - Requests for advice
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Timing Signals">
    - "Starting new role as..."
    - "Excited to announce..."
    - "We're hiring for..."
    - Conference hashtags and mentions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Start with 10-15 high-signal keywords. Monitor results for 30 days, then refine based on which keywords correlate with opportunities.
</Tip>

## Data Sources

Seam aggregates signals from multiple sources:

| Category | Sources |
|----------|---------|
| **First-Party** | Website tracking, CRM, marketing automation, sales engagement |
| **Job Data** | LinkedIn, job boards, company career pages |
| **Social** | LinkedIn, Twitter/X (posts, likes, comments, shares) |
| **Enrichment** | ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lucia, 20+ other providers |
| **Funding** | Crunchbase, PitchBook, press releases |
| **Intent** | Bombora (offsite keyword surges) |

The multi-provider waterfall approach ensures comprehensive signal coverage across geographies and company sizes.


## Integration with Scoring

Signals contribute to account prioritization alongside Fit and Intent:

**High-Priority Account Example:**
- **Fit Score:** A (perfect ICP match)
- **Intent Score:** High (visited pricing page 5 times)
- **Signal Score:** High (just raised Series B, hiring VP Sales)
- **Reach Score:** Low (not currently engaged)

→ **Action:** Top priority for immediate outreach with personalized, timely messaging

This account has the right profile, is showing interest, has a trigger event, and isn't being worked yet—perfect timing.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prioritize quality over quantity" icon="star">
    Don't track every possible signal. Focus on 3-5 signal types that historically correlate with closed deals.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Personalize outreach based on the signal" icon="message">
    "Saw you just hired a VP of Sales" is much more relevant than generic messaging. Reference the signal in your outreach.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Layer signals with fit" icon="layer-group">
    A funding signal only matters if the account is a good fit. Filter all signals through fit score to avoid wasted effort.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set timing windows" icon="clock">
    Some signals are time-sensitive (new hire has 90-day window), others are durable (funding lasts longer). Adjust urgency accordingly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Segment by account tier" icon="chart-pyramid">
    A-tier accounts get manual, personalized outreach on signals. B/C-tier accounts get automated plays. Don't treat all signals the same.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test messaging by signal type" icon="flask">
    Funding-based outreach should sound different from new-hire outreach. A/B test messaging for each signal category.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor signal-to-opportunity conversion" icon="chart-line">
    Track which signals actually lead to pipeline. Double down on high-converting signals, eliminate noise.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are signals different from intent?">
    **Signals** = External events at the company (new hires, funding, job posts)
    
    **Intent** = Engagement with your brand (website, email, ads)
    
    Signals indicate timing and opportunity. Intent indicates interest. Both together = high-priority account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How quickly are signals detected?">
    Depends on source:
    - Social signals: Real-time to hourly
    - Job postings: Daily
    - Funding: Within 24-48 hours of announcement
    - New hires: 1-7 days (based on LinkedIn updates)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I track custom signals specific to my industry?">
    Yes. You can configure custom signal definitions based on keywords, role titles, or company attributes specific to your business.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do signals consume credits?">
    Monitoring signals does not consume credits. Acting on signals (prospecting contacts, enrichment) consumes credits based on the actions taken.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I know which signals matter for my business?">
    Run a back-test: analyze your last 20 closed-won deals and identify common signals that were present before or during the sales cycle. Focus on those.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get alerted when specific signals fire?">
    Yes. Set up Slack notifications, email alerts, or CRM task creation when high-priority signals occur on A-tier accounts.
  </Accordion>
