Seam connects to your CRM, sales engagement tools, marketing automation platforms, data warehouses, and intent data sources, then consolidates everything into a unified data model. This gives you a single source of truth across all your GTM systems.

## How it works

When you connect data sources to Seam, we automatically:
1. **Ingest** data from each connected system
2. **Deduplicate** records across sources
3. **Enrich** with additional context and signals
4. **Unify** into five core datasets

This happens continuously—Seam syncs data every few hours so your unified view is always up to date.

## The five core datasets
