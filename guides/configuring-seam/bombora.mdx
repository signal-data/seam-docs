Bombora tracks when companies are actively researching specific topics across third-party websites and content networks. This provides early signals that an account may be in-market, allowing you to engage before they contact competitors or fill out forms.

## What is Bombora Intent?

Bombora monitors billions of content consumption signals across a cooperative network of B2B websites. When a company shows increased research activity on specific topics, Bombora generates "surging" scores that indicate buying intent.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Third-party signals**: Captures behavior outside your website
- **Topic-based tracking**: Monitors specific keywords, product categories, and competitors
- **Surge scoring**: Identifies when research activity spikes above baseline
- **Company-level data**: Aggregates individual behavior into account-level insights

## How Seam Uses Bombora Intent

### In Account Scoring

Bombora intent is one of four scoring dimensions in Seam:
```
Account Score = Fit + Intent + Signals + Reach
                       ↑
                  (includes Bombora)
```

High Bombora surge scores increase an account's overall intent score, helping you prioritize which accounts to target.

### In Automated Plays

Bombora intent can trigger plays automatically:

**Example Play: High-Intent Outreach**
1. Company surges on 5+ relevant Bombora topics
2. Seam AI researches and finds 3 buying committee members
3. Enriches contact data (emails, phone numbers)
4. Adds contacts to email sequence
5. Notifies assigned SDR with intent context

### In Audiences

Build dynamic audiences based on Bombora intent:

- "High-intent accounts researching ABM"
- "Accounts surging on competitor topics"
- "Mid-tier accounts showing interest" (air cover)

Audiences automatically update as companies surge or decline on topics.

### In CRM Sync

Bombora insights push directly into Salesforce:
- Intent score displayed on account records
- Trending topics shown in account details
- Alerts when accounts enter high-intent status

Sales reps see intent signals where they already work—no separate dashboard needed.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with 10-15 core topics" icon="lightbulb">
    Don't try to monitor everything. Focus on your most important product categories and top 3-5 competitors.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine with first-party signals" icon="merge">
    Bombora is most powerful when combined with website visits and email engagement. An account surging on Bombora topics AND visiting your pricing page is extremely high-intent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set appropriate thresholds" icon="sliders">
    If you have a long sales cycle, you may want to trigger on lower intent. Short cycles may require higher thresholds to focus on very active accounts.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review topics quarterly" icon="calendar">
    As your product evolves and market language changes, refresh your topic selections to stay relevant.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test and iterate" icon="flask">
    Start with one play triggered by Bombora intent. Measure results, then expand to more complex multi-signal plays.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often does Bombora data update?">
    Bombora updates weekly. Seam syncs new data every week and recalculates intent scores automatically.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I see which specific pages or content an account viewed?">
    No. Bombora provides topic-level aggregated data, not page-level detail. For page-level tracking, use Seam's web pixel for first-party intent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Bombora intent and website intent?">
    Bombora tracks research activity across third-party sites (offsite). Seam's web pixel tracks activity on your own website (onsite). Both are valuable and complement each other.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I know if Bombora topics are relevant?">
    Start with Seam's recommended topics based on your ICP. After 30 days, review which topics correlate with closed deals and refine your selection.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I track competitors?">
    Yes. You can add competitor company names as topics to see when accounts are researching alternative solutions.
