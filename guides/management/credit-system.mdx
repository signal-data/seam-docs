## Credit-based pricing model

Seam uses a credit-based pricing model where customers purchase an annual bucket of credits that are consumed throughout the year based on platform activities.

Our approach helps customers avoid over or under-purchasing credits by basing the recommendation on actual consumption patterns during the pilot phase.

## How credit estimation works

Rather than guessing your credit needs, Seam uses a data-driven approach to right-size your annual credit bucket:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Proof of concept">
    We run a POC to understand your actual usage patterns
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect to your systems">
    Seam integrates with your existing tech stack to gather real usage data during the pilot
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Annualize the data">
    We project your yearly credit needs based on the consumption patterns from the POC
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Recommend the right bucket">
    We recommend the appropriate annual credit bucket tailored to your specific use case
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This approach ensures you're purchasing the right amount of credits—not too many, not too few—based on how you actually use the platform.
</Note>
