To ensure secure access to Seam AIâ€™s API, all requests require authentication using **Basic Authentication**. This means you must include your API key in the Authorization header of each request.

## How to authenticate

Each request must include the following header:

```
Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can find your API key in your Seam AI settings. Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY`with your actual key.

## Keeping your API key secure

* Do not share your API key publicly or expose it in client-side code.

* If you suspect your API key has been compromised, regenerate it immediately from your account dashboard.

In the future, we may support additional authentication methods. Stay tuned for updates!
