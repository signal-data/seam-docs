## How credits work

Seam AI’s API follows a simple credit-based system.

* **1 credit** is consumed **per API call**, but only if a response is returned.

* If no result is found, no credits are used.

Your credit usage is tracked in your Seam AI dashboard. If you’re on a custom plan, credit consumption may vary.

For any questions about credits or usage limits, feel free to reach out!

<Info>
  During our private beta, the rate is **1 credit per call**. Please note that pricing and credit policies may change upon the General Availability (GA) release.
