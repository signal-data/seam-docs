## What is Seam AI?

Seam AIâ€™s Research Agent API empowers your sales team by automating the research process for accounts and contacts. Our service replicates the workflows of top sales representatives, handling tasks such as account qualification, identifying compelling events, and conducting buyer research. This ensures your team has access to comprehensive and up-to-date information without the manual effort.

Unlike traditional data vendors, our Research Agent aggregates data from a multitude of sources, including LinkedIn, job postings, and millions of websites, to provide tailored insights that align with your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). This approach guarantees a higher enrichment rate and more relevant data for your specific needs.

We prioritize data privacy and compliance, adhering to GDPR and CCPA regulations. Our system is designed to continuously enrich new records as they enter your systems, ensuring your data remains current and actionable.

## How the API works

The Seam AI API operates synchronously, similar to the OpenAI Completions API. When you submit a request, the API processes it immediately and returns the result in the response. This design simplifies integration, as you receive the output directly without the need for additional handling mechanisms like webhooks or polling.

1. **Request Submission**: You send a POST request to the API endpoint with your input data.

2. **Processing**: The API processes your input in real-time, performing the necessary computations or data retrievals.

3. **Immediate Response**: Upon completion, the API returns the result directly in the response body.
