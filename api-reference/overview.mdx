## What is Seam AI?

Seam AIâ€™s Research Agent API empowers your sales team by automating the research process for accounts and contacts. Our service replicates the workflows of top sales representatives, handling tasks such as account qualification, identifying compelling events, and conducting buyer research. This ensures your team has access to comprehensive and up-to-date information without the manual effort.

Unlike traditional data vendors, our Research Agent aggregates data from a multitude of sources, including LinkedIn, job postings, and millions of websites, to provide tailored insights that align with your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). This approach guarantees a higher enrichment rate and more relevant data for your specific needs.

We prioritize data privacy and compliance, adhering to GDPR and CCPA regulations. Our system is designed to continuously enrich new records as they enter your systems, ensuring your data remains current and actionable.
