Seam AI’s API currently has no rate limits, allowing unrestricted requests. However, we plan to introduce rate limits soon to ensure consistent performance for all users.

## What to expect:

* A maximum request limit per minute will be set.

* If you exceed the limit, you may receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response.

* You can implement **retry logic** and **monitor usage** to handle limits smoothly.

We’ll share details before the limits take effect. If you need higher limits, feel free to reach out!
