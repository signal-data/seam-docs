Seam AI’s API is designed to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse by enforcing rate limits on the number of API calls. Rate limits may vary based on your pricing plan.

## What to expect:

* A maximum request limit per minute will be enforced based on your plan.

* If you exceed the limit, you may receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response.

* Implementing **retry logic** and **monitoring usage** will help manage rate limits smoothly.

If you’re a technology partner and want to increase your rate limit, feel free to reach out to us.
