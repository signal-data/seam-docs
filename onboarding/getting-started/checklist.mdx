## Onboarding Timeline

Here's what a typical onboarding looks like:

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
| :--- | :---- | :----------- |
| **Weeks 1-2** | Data & Setup | CRM connected, web pixel live, sales tools integrated, intent keywords configured |
| **Weeks 2-3** | Intelligence & Launch | Fit scoring calibrated, personas created, audiences built, first play launched |


## Phase 1: Setup

Connect your data sources and start capturing intent signals.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your CRM">
    Link Salesforce or HubSpot to sync accounts, contacts, and opportunities.
    
    [Connect data sources →](/onboarding/setup/connecting-data-sources)
    
    **Time estimate:** 30 minutes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect sales & marketing tools">
    Integrate sales engagement platforms (Outreach, SalesLoft) and marketing automation (Marketo, LinkedIn Ads, Google Ads).
    
    [Connect data sources →](/onboarding/setup/connecting-data-sources)
    
    **Time estimate:** 1-2 hours
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install web pixel">
    Add Seam's tracking pixel to your website to capture first-party intent data from anonymous visitors.
    
    [Install web pixel →](/onboarding/setup/installing-web-pixel)
    
    **Time estimate:** 15 minutes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set intent keywords">
    Configure which pages and topics indicate buying intent (pricing page, competitor comparison pages, high-value content).
    
    [Set intent keywords →](/onboarding/setup/setting-intent-keywords)
    
    **Time estimate:** 30 minutes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**What happens next:** Seam begins building your unified data model and capturing intent signals. Data typically syncs within 24 hours.
</Info>

## Phase 2: Configure

Build your intelligence layer by defining your ICP, personas, and automation triggers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure ICP fit scoring">
    Define your ideal customer profile criteria and run a backtest on 45 accounts (15 good customers, 15 bad fits, 15 random) to calibrate the AI.
    
    [Configure ICP fit →](/onboarding/configure/configuring-icp-fit)
    
    **Time estimate:** 2-3 hours (includes backtest)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create personas">
    Define the job titles and roles you want to target at each account (e.g., VP Marketing, Director Demand Gen, RevOps Manager).
    
    [Create personas →](/onboarding/configure/creating-personas)
    
    **Time estimate:** 1 hour
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure signals">
    Set up external buying signals like new hires, funding announcements, job openings, and social mentions.
    
    [Configure signals →](/onboarding/configure/configuring-signals)
    
    **Time estimate:** 1 hour
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create audiences">
    Build dynamic segments that combine fit scoring, intent, signals, and account attributes (e.g., "High-fit accounts showing intent").
    
    [Create audiences →](/onboarding/configure/creating-audiences)
    
    **Time estimate:** 1-2 hours
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**What happens next:** Seam begins scoring your account universe and identifying high-priority targets based on your configuration.
</Info>

## Phase 3: Orchestrate

Launch your first automated play to start engaging prospects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up routing queues">
    Configure the list of sales reps and internal users to route actions to.
    
    [Configure routing queue →](/onboarding/orchestrate/routing-queue)
    
    **Time estimate:** 30 minutes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch your first play">
    Start with a simple always-on play like "High-intent website visitors" or "New executive outreach" to see immediate results.
    
    [Create your first play →](/onboarding/orchestrate/plays)
    
    **Time estimate:** 1-2 hours
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor and optimize">
    Review play performance, credit usage, and contact quality. Adjust audience criteria and contact limits as needed.
    
    **Time estimate:** Ongoing
  </Step>
