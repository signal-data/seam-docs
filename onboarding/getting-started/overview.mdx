## What is Seam AI?

Seam AI is an AI-native account-based marketing platform that helps B2B teams generate pipeline faster and more efficiently. Our platform uses AI agents to automate the entire ABM workflow, from identifying best-fit accounts to executing multi-channel campaigns when buying signals spike.

</Frame>

Seam replaces manual ABM processes with AI agents that work 24/7:

1. **Connect your data** - Integrate your CRM, marketing automation, and data sources
2. **Configure your ICP** - Define what makes an account a good fit using custom criteria
3. **Set up monitoring and intelligence** - Track intent signals across 1st and 3rd party sources
4. **Launch plays** - Create automated campaigns triggered by fit, intent, and signals
5. **Drive pipeline** - Watch as Seam sources contacts and generates measurable opportunities
