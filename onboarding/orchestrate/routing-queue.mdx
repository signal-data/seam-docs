description: "Create reusable groups of sales reps for automated contact distribution"

Routing queues are reusable groups of sales reps that determine how new contacts are assigned when Seam deploys them from plays.

<Info>
Set up your queues before launching plays so contacts can be automatically routed to the right reps.
</Info>

## Why Create Queues?

Instead of manually assigning contacts every time a play runs, queues let you define distribution rules once and reuse them across multiple plays.

**Common use cases:**
- **Round robin:** Distribute leads evenly across your SDR team
- **Regional teams:** Route contacts by geography (West Coast, EMEA, APAC)
- **Vertical specialization:** Assign contacts based on industry expertise
- **Account-based:** Route to specific account owners or account teams

## Creating a Queue

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Routing">
    In Seam, go to **Configuration → Routing** in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a new queue">
    Click **Add queue** to open the queue creation dialog.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your queue">
    Give your queue a descriptive name (e.g., "SDR Round Robin", "Enterprise AEs - West", "Healthcare Specialists").
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select members">
    Choose which team members should be included in this queue. These should match users from your connected CRM or sales engagement platform.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the queue. You can now use it in play routing configurations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup cols={2}>
  <Accordion title="Descriptive names" icon="tag">
    Use clear naming conventions that explain the queue's purpose (who and when)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep them updated" icon="rotate">
    Review queues quarterly as team members join/leave or territories change
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Match capacity" icon="scale-balanced">
    Balance queue sizes based on rep capacity, not just headcount
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test before deploying" icon="flask">
    Create a small test play to verify contacts route correctly before scaling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
**Start simple:** Create 1-2 basic queues (like a general SDR round robin) to get started. You can add more specialized queues as you launch additional plays.
