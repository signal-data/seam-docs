## Building a Play

### Step-by-Step Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Play Type">
    Decide if this is always-on or one-off based on your use case
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Your Audience">
    Use the Audience Builder to set criteria:
    
    - **Fit Score:** A or B (only target good-fit accounts)
    - **Intent:** Visited website 3+ times in past 7 days
    - **Signals:** Not in open opportunity
    - **Exclusions:** Not competitors, not existing customers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Prospecting">
    Set up contact sourcing:
    
    - Select personas to target (e.g., VP Marketing, Director Demand Gen)
    - Set contacts per account (3-5 for most plays)
    - Enable/disable prospecting if contacts already exist
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Enrichment Options">
    Configure data quality:
    
    - Email verification level (standard or triple-verified)
    - Mobile number enrichment (optional, costs more credits)
    - Duplicate checking (recommended to avoid over-contacting)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Routing">
    Assign contacts to the right reps:
    
    - Account owner (most common)
    - Round robin (for fair distribution)
    - Custom field (for complex territory logic)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Deployment">
    Choose where contacts should go:
    
    - **CRM:** Create/update records in Salesforce or HubSpot
    - **Sales Sequences:** Add to Outreach, SalesLoft, or Apollo
    - **Ad Platforms:** Push to LinkedIn or Google matched audiences
    - **Marketing Automation:** Trigger Marketo campaigns
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and Launch">
    - Preview the audience size
    - Test with a small subset first (10-20 accounts)
    - Monitor results for 1-2 weeks
    - Scale up once validated
  </Step>
