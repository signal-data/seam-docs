## Setting Up Bombora

### Step 1: Select Topics to Monitor

Navigate to **Settings → Seam Intent → Topics**. Choose up to 25 topics that align with your product, competitors, or buyer interests.

**Topic categories include:**
- Product categories (e.g., "Sales Intelligence", "AI ABM")
- Competitor names
- Use cases and pain points
- Industry-specific solutions
- Technology categories

<Tip>
Seam provides topic recommendations during onboarding based on your ICP and market. Start with suggested topics, then refine based on results.

### Step 2: Configure Intent Thresholds

Set thresholds for when Bombora signals should trigger actions:

- **Low Intent**: Surging on 1-2 topics
- **Medium Intent**: Surging on 3-5 topics
- **High Intent**: Surging on 6+ topics or critical topics

You can adjust these thresholds based on your sales cycle and ICP.

### Step 3: Enable in Scoring & Plays

Once configured, Bombora intent automatically:
- Contributes to account **intent scores**
- Triggers **automated plays** when thresholds are met
- Appears in **audience filters** and segments
- Syncs to **Salesforce** for rep visibility
