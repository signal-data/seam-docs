## Defining your fit criteria

Configure custom criteria using natural language prompts. Fit Score can answer questions that traditional data providers can't:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Firmographic criteria" icon="building">
    - Employee count ranges
    - Revenue or funding stage
    - Geographic location
    - Company age
    - Growth rate
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Technographic criteria" icon="microchip">
    - "Does this company use Snowflake or Databricks?"
    - "Do they have internal and external APIs?"
    - "What is their IT environment?"
    - "Do they use a specific tech stack?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Business model criteria" icon="diagram-project">
    - "How big is their Total Addressable Market?"
    - "Do they serve B2B or B2C customers?"
    - "Are they a marketplace or direct seller?"
    - "Do they underwrite merchants?" (fintech)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compliance & security" icon="shield-check">
    - "Do they have SOC 2 compliance?"
    - "Are they in a highly regulated industry?"
    - "Do they handle sensitive data?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use case indicators" icon="magnifying-glass">
    - "How many languages do they need for localization?"
    - "Do they have distributed teams?"
    - "What's their content production volume?"
    - "Do they process high-volume transactions?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Disqualification criteria" icon="ban">
    - "Is this company a direct competitor?"
    - "Are they too small for our product?"
    - "Do they serve industries we don't support?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Start with 5-10 clear criteria that reflect your closed-won customer patterns. You can refine and expand after back-testing.
</Tip>

## Multiple fit models

Create different fit models for different segments or use cases:

- **SaaS fit score** - Criteria for software companies
- **Manufacturing fit score** - Criteria for industrial businesses  
- **Enterprise fit score** - Criteria for large accounts
- **SMB fit score** - Criteria for small/mid-market
- **Product line A** - Criteria for specific product vertical

Each model can have completely different criteria and grading logic.

## Back-testing your fit model

Before deploying, Seam validates your criteria with a 45-account test:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select test accounts">
    - 15 known good accounts (closed-won customers)
    - 15 known bad accounts (lost deals, poor fits)
    - 15 random accounts from your TAM
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run fit score">
    Seam scores all 45 accounts using your criteria
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validate results">
    Verify that:
    - Good accounts score A or B
    - Bad accounts score C or D
    - Random accounts distribute appropriately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refine criteria">
    Adjust criteria if results don't align with expectations, then retest
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Don't skip back-testing!** This ensures your criteria accurately identify the right accounts before you spend credits scoring your entire TAM.
</Warning>

## How scores are displayed

### Detailed explanations

Every Fit Score includes a detailed explanation:

> "This account scored a **B** because it is headquartered in the US, operates in a target industry, has 500-2,000 employees, and serves a TAM larger than 75,000 accounts. However, it lacks SOC 2 compliance, which is preferred for enterprise deals."

### CRM integration

Fit Scores sync directly to your CRM:
- Displayed as fields on Account records
- Explanation text stored in custom fields
- Available for reporting, filtering, and workflows
- Visible to sales reps without logging into Seam
