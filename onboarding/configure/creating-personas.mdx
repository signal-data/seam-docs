## Configuring Personas

### Title-Based Targeting

Define personas using specific job titles:

**Example: Data Engineering Persona**
- Include: "VP of Data", "Head of Data Engineering", "Director of Analytics", "Chief Data Officer"
- Exclude: "Data Analyst", "Junior Data Engineer"
- Seniority: Director and above

**Example: Growth Marketing Persona**
- Include: "VP of Growth", "Director of Demand Generation", "Head of Growth Marketing"
- Exclude: "Product Marketing", "Content Marketing", "Brand Marketing"
- Seniority: Manager and above

### Keyword Matching

Add keywords that appear in LinkedIn profiles to refine targeting:

**Example: RevOps Persona**
- Titles: "VP RevOps", "Director Revenue Operations"
- Keywords: "Salesforce admin", "revenue architecture", "sales operations"
- Exclude Keywords: "customer success operations", "support operations"

This catches people with non-standard titles who still match your target profile.

### Priority Ordering

Order personas by importance to your business:

1. **Priority 1:** VP of Sales (highest value, hardest to reach)
2. **Priority 2:** Director of Sales Operations (strong influence)
3. **Priority 3:** Sales Development Manager (user/champion)

When Seam prospects, it fills contacts in priority order until reaching your specified limit per account.

### Contact Limits

Set how many people to find per account:

- **High-value accounts (Tier 1):** 5-7 contacts across all personas
- **Mid-tier accounts (Tier 2):** 3-5 contacts
- **Programmatic accounts (Tier 3):** 1-2 contacts

More contacts = better buying committee coverage but higher costs (credits per contact).

<Tip>
Start with 3 contacts per account. This ensures you're not single-threaded but keeps costs manageable.
