## Configuring Personas

### Title-Based Targeting

Define personas using specific job titles:

**Example: Data Engineering Persona**
- Include: "VP of Data", "Head of Data Engineering", "Director of Analytics", "Chief Data Officer"
- Exclude: "Data Analyst", "Junior Data Engineer"
- Seniority: Director and above

**Example: Growth Marketing Persona**
- Include: "VP of Growth", "Director of Demand Generation", "Head of Growth Marketing"
- Exclude: "Product Marketing", "Content Marketing", "Brand Marketing"
- Seniority: Manager and above

### Keyword Matching

Add keywords to refine targeting:

**Example: RevOps Persona**
- Titles: "VP RevOps", "Director Revenue Operations"
- Keywords: "Salesforce admin", "revenue architecture", "sales operations"
- Exclude Keywords: "customer success operations", "support operations"

This catches people with non-standard titles who still match your target profile.
