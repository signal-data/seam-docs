Seam connects to Google Ads using OAuth. Your Google user account must have access to at least one Google Ads account.

## Step 1: Navigate to Connections

In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.

## Step 2: Connect to Google Ads

1. Find **Google Ads** in the connections list and click **Connect**.
2. Complete the OAuth flow by logging into your Google account.
3. Select which Google Ads accounts (parent and/or child accounts) to give Seam access to.
4. Check the box to certify permission for syncing audiences to Google Ads.
5. Click **Save**.

## What Gets Synced

**From Google Ads (Source):**
- Ad and campaign performance reports
- Used for tracking ad engagement and conversions by account

**To Google Ads (Destination):**
- Deploy Seam audiences as customer match lists
- Sync conversion events

## Using Google Ads in Plays

When configuring a play, you can deploy Seam audiences to Google Ads as customer match lists for targeted advertising campaigns. Audiences automatically sync to keep your ad targeting up-to-date.

<Info>
User lists can take 5-48 hours to process in Google Ads after Seam syncs the data.
