Seam connects to GitHub using OAuth. Your GitHub account must have read, write, or admin permissions for the repositories you want to access.

## Step 1: Navigate to Connections

In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.

## Step 2: Connect to GitHub

1. Find **GitHub** in the connections list and click **Connect**.
2. Complete the OAuth flow by logging into GitHub and authorizing Seam.
3. Select which GitHub repositories to grant Seam access to.
4. Click **Save**.

## What Gets Synced

**From GitHub (Source):**
- Repository activity, commits, pull requests, issues
- Developer community engagement and contributions

## Using GitHub in Seam

GitHub data enriches your unified data model with developer community signals, useful for identifying high-engagement accounts in developer-focused products.
