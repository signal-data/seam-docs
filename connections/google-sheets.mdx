Seam connects to Google Sheets using either OAuth (personal Google Account) or a Google Service Account (credential not tied to a person).

## Method 1: OAuth Connection

### Step 1: Navigate to Connections

In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.

### Step 2: Connect with Google OAuth

1. Find **Google Sheets** in the connections list and click **Connect**.
2. Click **Continue with Google** to complete the OAuth flow.
3. Choose your spreadsheet in the popup window.
4. Click **Save**.

<Info>
You can re-authenticate with a different Google account by clicking **Force reconnect** in the connection settings.

## Method 2: Service Account Connection

Use this method for connections not tied to a specific person's account.

### Step 1: Create a Service Account

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create) to create a new service account.
2. Create a new JSON key by going to **KEYS** tab → **ADD KEY** → **Create new key**.
3. Choose **JSON** and click **Create**. The key will download automatically.

### Step 2: Enable Google Sheets API

Visit the [API Enablement Wizard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com/overview) and enable the Google Sheets API for your project.

### Step 3: Grant Sheet Access

In your Google Sheet, add the Service Account email address (found in the JSON key) as an **Editor**.

### Step 4: Configure in Seam

1. In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.
2. Find **Google Sheets** and click **Connect**.
3. Select **Service Account** from the **Authentication method** dropdown.
4. Upload the JSON service account key.
5. Choose your spreadsheet and click **Save**.

<Tip>
When rotating keys, maintain the same service account to avoid re-inviting it to all sheets.
</Tip>

## Configuration Options

### Header Row

Check the **Columns have headers** box if your sheet's first row contains column headers. This ensures Seam treats it as a header rather than data.

### Column Types

By default, Google Sheets columns are treated as strings. To enable richer type inference, set [data validation rules](https://support.google.com/appsheet/answer/10107325?hl=en) in Google Sheets for numeric, date, or boolean columns.

## What Gets Synced

**From Google Sheets (Source):**
- Sheet data for use in audiences, personas, or custom lists
- Common use: maintaining target account lists, persona definitions, or exclusion lists

**To Google Sheets (Destination):**
- Export Seam audiences, fit scores, or intent data for analysis
- Common use: sharing ABM metrics with stakeholders or feeding other tools

## Using Google Sheets in Seam

Google Sheets is useful for:
- **Custom account lists:** Maintain dynamic target lists outside your CRM
- **Persona configuration:** Define and manage persona criteria in sheets
- **Exclusion lists:** Track do-not-contact or customer accounts
- **Data sharing:** Export Seam intelligence for external analysis or reporting
