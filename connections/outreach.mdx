Seam connects to Outreach using OAuth. Ensure the connecting user has **Admin** permissions in Outreach.

## Step 1: Navigate to Connections

In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.

## Step 2: Connect to Outreach

1. Find **Outreach** in the connections list and click **Connect**.
2. Complete the OAuth flow by logging into Outreach and authorizing Seam.
3. Once authorized, Seam will begin syncing your sequences, prospects, and accounts.

## What Gets Synced

**From Outreach (Source):**
- Prospects, Accounts, Sequences, Activities, Mailings
- Used for Reach scoring and engagement tracking

**To Outreach (Destination):**
- Deploy contacts to sequences from Seam plays
- Create or update Prospect and Account records

## Using Outreach in Plays

When configuring a play, select Outreach as the deployment destination to automatically add contacts to sequences. You can map Seam fields (Play, Persona, Fit Score) to Outreach custom fields for rep visibility.

<Info>
If a contact doesn't exist in Outreach, Seam automatically creates the prospect record before adding them to your sequence.
