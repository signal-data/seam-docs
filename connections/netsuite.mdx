## Step 2: Create an Integration

1. Go to **Setup → Integrations → Manage Integrations → New**.
2. Name it "Seam" and enable "Token-based authentication".
3. Save and note the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.

## Step 3: Create a Role

1. Go to **Setup → Users/Roles → Manage Roles → New**.
2. Name it "Seam" and check "Web Services Only Role".
3. Add required permissions (Lists, Transactions, Reports, Setup tabs).

## Step 4: Create an Access Token

1. Go to **Setup → Users/Roles → Access Tokens → New**.
2. Select your Seam Integration, User, and Role.
3. Save and note the **Token ID** and **Token Secret**.

## Step 5: Configure the connection in Seam

1. In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.
2. Find **NetSuite** and click **Connect**.
3. Enter your NetSuite Account ID (found in **Setup → Company → Company Information**).
4. Enter the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Token ID, and Token Secret.
5. Click **Save**.

## What Gets Synced

**From NetSuite (Source):**
- Customers, Invoices, Sales Orders, Transactions, Accounts
- Financial data, billing records, payment information

**To NetSuite (Destination):**
- Customer and account updates from Seam

<Info>
NetSuite syncs four objects at a time due to concurrency limits. Additional objects are automatically queued.
