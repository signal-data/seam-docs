Seam connects to Smartlead using an API key.

## Step 1: Obtain your API key

Log into Smartlead and navigate to your [Settings page](https://app.smartlead.ai/app/settings/profile) to copy your API key.

## Step 2: Configure the connection in Seam

1. In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.
2. Find **Smartlead** in the connections list and click **Connect**.
3. Enter your Smartlead API key and click **Save**.

## What Gets Synced

**From Smartlead (Source):**
- Campaigns, Campaign statistics, Clients, Leads, Message History
- Used for Reach scoring and engagement tracking

**To Smartlead (Destination):**
- Deploy contacts to campaigns from Seam plays
- Create or update Lead records

## Using Smartlead in Plays

When configuring a play, select Smartlead as the deployment destination to automatically add contacts to campaigns. You can map Seam fields (Play, Persona, Fit Score) to Smartlead custom fields.

<Info>
If a contact doesn't exist in Smartlead, Seam automatically creates the lead record before adding them to your campaign.
