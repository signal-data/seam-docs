We require three values to connect Marketo to Seam.

* Client ID

* Client Secret

* Web Service REST Endpoint

## Step 1: Obtain the Client ID and Secret

The Client ID and Client Secret can be obtained by logging into Marketo and going to **Admin** → **Integration** → **Launchpoint** then selecting a service and clicking **View Details**.

## Step 2: Obtain the Web Service REST Endpoint

Remaining in Marketo, the Web Service REST Endpoint can be obtained by going to **Admin** → **Integration** → **Web Services**.
