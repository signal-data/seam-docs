## Prerequisites

Before connecting Salesforce to Seam, ensure you have:

1. A [Salesforce Account](https://login.salesforce.com/) with Enterprise access or API quota purchased
2. (Optional) A dedicated Salesforce [user](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=adding_new_users.htm&type=5&language=en_US) for Seam integration

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Create a Dedicated Salesforce User (Optional)

While you can connect Salesforce using any user with read and write permissions, we recommend creating a dedicated integration user for better security and tracking.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Setup">
    [Log into Salesforce](https://login.salesforce.com/) with an admin account. Click the gear icon in the top right, then click **Setup**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Profile">
    In the left navigation bar, go to **Administration** > **Users** > **Profiles**. Click **New Profile**.
    
    - **Profile Name**: Enter `Seam Integration User`
    - Click **Save**, then click **Edit**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Object Permissions">
    Scroll down to **Standard Object Permissions** and **Custom Object Permissions**. Enable the **Read and Write** checkbox for all objects you want to replicate via Seam.
    
    Click **Save** when finished.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New User">
    In the left navigation, go to **Administration** > **Users** > **Users**. Click **New User**.
    
    Fill out the required fields:
    - **License**: Select `Salesforce`
    - **Profile**: Select `Seam Integration User`
    - **Email**: Use an email address you can access
    
    Click **Save** and copy the **Username** for later use.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify and Set Password">
    Check the email you provided and verify your new Salesforce user account. Set a password during the verification process and save it for the next step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Connect Salesforce to Seam

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Connections">
    [Log in to Seam](https://app.getseam.ai/) and click **Settings** in the left navigation bar. Go to the **Connections** tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Salesforce Source">
    Click **+ New connection** in the top-right corner and select **Salesforce** from the list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Click **Login with Salesforce** to authorize your account. Seam will authenticate the Salesforce account you're currently logged into.
    
    <Warning>
    Ensure you're logged into the correct Salesforce account before authenticating.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Connection">
    - Toggle whether your account is a [Sandbox](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.deploy_sandboxes_parent.htm&type=5) or Production account
    - Select the **Objects** you want Seam to access
    - Enter a **Source name** to identify this connection
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Click **Finish** to complete the connection. Seam will begin syncing your Salesforce data.
  </Step>
</Steps>
