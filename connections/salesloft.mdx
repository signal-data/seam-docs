Seam connects to Salesloft using OAuth. Ensure the connecting user has **read-write** permissions in Salesloft.

## Step 1: Navigate to Connections

In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.

## Step 2: Connect to Salesloft

1. Find **Salesloft** in the connections list and click **Connect**.
2. Complete the OAuth flow by logging into Salesloft and authorizing Seam.
3. Once authorized, Seam will begin syncing your cadences, people, and accounts.

## What Gets Synced

**From Salesloft (Source):**
- People, Accounts, Cadences, Teams, Users, Activities
- Used for Reach scoring and engagement tracking

**To Salesloft (Destination):**
- Deploy contacts to cadences from Seam plays
- Create or update People and Account records

## Using Salesloft in Plays

When configuring a play, select Salesloft as the deployment destination to automatically add contacts to cadences. You can map Seam fields (Play, Persona, Fit Score) to Salesloft custom fields for rep visibility.

<Info>
If a contact doesn't exist in Salesloft, Seam automatically creates the person record before adding them to your cadence.
