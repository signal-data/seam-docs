## Prerequisites
<Warning>
**Firewall Configuration Required**

If your database is behind a firewall, you must allow connections from the following Seam IP addresses:
- 34.171.4.17
- 54.190.82.25
- 44.232.40.21
- 35.155.106.54
- 54.200.67.134
- 44.224.213.129
- 54.149.95.139
</Warning>

We need the following details for Azure Synapse:

* Server (SQL endpoint from your Synapse workspace)

* Database

* Username

* Password

* Port (default: 1433)

## Permissions

We recommend creating a dedicated user for Seam to ensure audit logs clearly distinguish Seam activity from other operations. At a minimum, the Seam user needs:

* **`SELECT`** permission on tables you want to read from

* **`INSERT`** and **`UPDATE`** permissions on tables you want to write to

* **`CREATE TABLE`** permission if you want Seam to create new tables

## I. Obtaining Your Server Credentials

1. In Azure Portal, navigate to **Synapse workspaces**.
2. Select the workspace you want to connect to.
3. Go to **Overview**.
4. Locate the **SQL endpoint** - this is your Server value.

## II. Setting Up a User

Create a dedicated user for Seam in your Azure Synapse Portal:

```sql
CREATE LOGIN seam_user WITH PASSWORD = 'your-own-super-secure-password';

CREATE USER seam_user FOR LOGIN seam_user;
```

Grant the necessary permissions based on your use case:

```sql
-- For reading data (Source)
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::dbo TO seam_user;

-- For writing data (Destination)
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON SCHEMA::dbo TO seam_user;

-- For creating tables
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO seam_user;
```

Adjust schema names (`dbo`) and permissions as needed for your specific setup.

## III. Connecting to Seam

1. In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.
2. Find **Azure Synapse** and click **Connect**.
3. Enter your connection details:
   - **Server:** Your SQL endpoint (from Step I)
   - **Database:** The database name
   - **Username:** `seam_user` (or your chosen username)
   - **Password:** The password you set
   - **Port:** 1433 (default)
4. Click **Save**.

## IV. Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If the connection fails, verify:

1. **Firewall rules:** Ensure Seam's IP addresses are whitelisted in your Azure Synapse firewall settings.
2. **Credentials:** Double-check the server endpoint, database name, username, and password.
3. **Network policies:** Check if your workspace has additional network restrictions.

### Tables Do Not Appear in Seam

If tables or schemas are not visible, ensure:

1. The Seam user has `SELECT` permission on the relevant schemas and tables.
2. The database name in your connection matches the database containing your tables.
3. Tables exist in the schema you're querying.

### Permission Denied Errors

If you encounter permission errors during sync:

1. Verify the Seam user has appropriate permissions (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE TABLE`).
2. Check that permissions are granted at both the schema and table level.
3. Ensure the user can connect to the specific database.
