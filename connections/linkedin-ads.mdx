Seam connects to LinkedIn Ads using OAuth.

## Step 1: Navigate to Connections

In Seam, go to **Settings → Connections**.

## Step 2: Connect to LinkedIn Ads

2. Complete the OAuth flow by logging into your LinkedIn account.
3. Select which LinkedIn Ads accounts you'd like to connect to Seam.
4. Click **Save**.

## What Gets Synced

**From LinkedIn Ads (Source):**
- Ad and campaign performance reports
- Used for tracking ad engagement and conversions by account

**To LinkedIn Ads (Destination):**
- Deploy Seam audiences as company or user audiences
- Sync conversion events

## Using LinkedIn Ads in Plays

When configuring a play, you can deploy Seam audiences to LinkedIn Ads for targeted ABM campaigns. Audiences automatically sync to keep your ad targeting up-to-date based on fit, intent, and signals.

<Info>
When syncing audiences, use two-letter country codes (e.g., "US", "GB") rather than full country names.
