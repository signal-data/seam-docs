## Option 1: Google Tag Manager

To streamline script management — especially while that using several tracking tools — you can deploy the Seam AI website tag through Google Tag Manager (GTM).

Start by launching the GTM console. Go to **Tags**, then click **New** to create a new tag. In the **Tag Configuration** panel, choose **Custom HTML** as the tag type.

From your Seam AI settings, copy the website tag snippet provided. Paste this snippet into the **HTML** field in Google tag manager. Make sure to allow access to **All pages**. Once you’re done, click **Save** to finalize the setup.

For additional guidance, refer to the official [Google Tag Manager support documentation](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6107167?hl=en).

## Option 2: Webflow

Webflow provides a built-in area for inserting custom code directly into your site.

To get started, go to your Webflow dashboard, open the **Settings** for your site, and click the **Custom Code** tab in the left-hand menu.

In the **Head Code** section, paste the Seam AI website tag from your Seam AI settings into the text area. If there’s already code in place, be sure to add the Seam script on a new line to keep things organized.

Once you’ve added the tag, click **Save**, then apply your changes by selecting **Publish → Publish to selected domains** in the upper-right corner.

## Option 3: Direct embed

You can directly embed the Seam AI intent script by adding a `<script>` tag to your website’s HTML — either within the `<head>` or `<body>` section.

The script is available in your Seam AI settings. Simply copy the code snippet and paste it into your site’s HTML to enable tracking.

```markdown index.html
<!-- Place in the <head> or <body> of your site -->
<script>
  // Seam AI script goes here
</script>
```

Once the tag is in place, no additional setup is required. The Seam AI website tag will immediately begin capturing visitor identification data automatically.

## Credits

Seam AI uses a credit-based system where **1 credit is consumed for each successful website reveal**—when a visitor is deanonymized through Seam Intent. Credits are only used when identification is successful; anonymous visits do not count toward usage.
